# Features
The planner has a few features to improve the user experience

&#10004; Reset button allows you to immediately clear local storage. Click it twice to also delete your current text in the boxes.

&#10004; Current date and time always updates.

&#10004; Boxes are color coded to give immediate visual contrast to your day.

&#10004; Data you enter can be saved with just the click of a button.

## Summary
This planner was a good experience for me to implement jQuery. I modified the existing CSS slightly but would like to make more updates before the end of 2021. 

I also would like to work on clearing the entries "without" having to click the reset button twice. Attempted to do a page reload inside JS but it wouldn't stop reloading.
