## Project Description
This site allows you to view current weather and a five day forecast. As a new developer, "da-Weather" taught me how to incorporate a third-party-API (OpenWeather.org) into a page. I also learned how to convert a city name into a latitude and longitude, live with JavaScript and jQuery! It was fun to expirement with the different parameters provided by the API's and implement the content to the page in a split-second.

# Features
"da-Weather!" will show the current weather along with a 5day forecast. Cute icons give you a visual feeling to the weather as well.

&#10004; Local storage allows you to quickly search previous cities again.

&#10004; Current date and time always updates in the navBar.

&#10004; 5 day forecast boxes are in nicely spaced, clearly defined sections.

&#10004; The city you enter and the day of the week appear in the header after you search.

&#10004; Dark blue color palette and subtle borders make for clean styling.

## Summary
"da-Weather" was really fun to work on! I did struggle quite a bit with local storage but I felt really good about dynamically populating the 5 day forecast boxes using jQuery and template literals. This really strengthened my ability to use template literals to return specific API data to the page. 

I intend to work more on the local storage and add in a nice background image as well.
